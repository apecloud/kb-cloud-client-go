    ***KubeBlocks Cloud API*** is a RESTful API for managing KubeBlocks Cloud resources.

    The API is organized around REST.

    Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts `JSON-encoded` request bodies, returns `JSON-encoded` responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

    We use standard HTTP authentication and provide API keys to identify who you are. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
